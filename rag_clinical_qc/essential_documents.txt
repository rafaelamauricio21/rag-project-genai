### 8.1 Introduction
Essential Documents are those which permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced. They demonstrate compliance with GCP standards and regulatory requirements.

These documents:
- Support successful trial management
- Are subject to audit and inspection
- Are grouped by trial phase: before, during, after
- Must be filed at both investigator and sponsor sites
- Should be traceable, version-controlled, and securely archived

ADDENDUM: Both sponsor and investigator must track document location, ensure certified copies if originals are replaced, and confirm continuous access to CRF data by the investigator.
